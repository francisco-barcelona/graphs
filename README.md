Graphs algorithms to study

Folder DFS-BFS-queue contains a console application to obtain the path in a not oriented graph by Deep First Search and Breadth First Search.
The user must write at the beggining the number of vertex/node, the number of edges and, finally, the adjacencies between the vertex.
The program outputs the BFS (using a queue) and DFS (using recursion) paths.
